## Description
The goal of the project is to implement a game AI. We intend to create an agent for the game "Super Mario Bros" that can play the game and reach the goal.
The project uses a modified version of the public domain clone of Nintendo's classic platform game - Super Mario Bros called "Infinite Mario Bros".
The APIs have been provided by the competition authorities and with the help of those we have created a rule based agent which can play the game efficiently.
